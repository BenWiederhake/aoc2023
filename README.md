My very own solutions to the fantastic [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com).

- 2023: Just getting my hands dirty for the first time; no serious participation
- 2024: Having a bit more fun; mostly written in preparation for 2025.
- 2025: I want to get some experience solving "real" tasks with C#, so I solve everything in C#.
